## Operational State

- deterministic execution flow: ready
- CLI execution contract: ready
- operator console execution contract: ready
- browser interaction E2E: ready
- reference adoption aggregate: ready, 15 scripts, ok=true, totalDuration=30.3s
- deterministic runtime summary: ready
- snapshot portability: not archived
- OpenAI live validation: passed
- Anthropic live validation: failed (anthropic live mission run failed | rootDir=<temp>/personal-ai-agent-live-anthropic-S78A4H | workspaceId=workspace_20260505160104_ea885a | missionId=mission_20260505160104_5c9b4f | artifact=manager-prompt.md | sessionId=session_20260505160104_292515 | missionStatus=failed)
- local provider live validation: blocked by missing `LOCAL_PROVIDER_BASE_URL`
- Hermes live validation: blocked by missing `HERMES_PROVIDER_MODEL`

## Live Failure Triage Summary

- OpenAI: no active blocker
- Anthropic: http-status, HTTP 400, Your credit balance is too low to access the Anthropic API. Please go to Plans & Billing to upgrade or purchase credits.
- local provider: missing `LOCAL_PROVIDER_BASE_URL`
- Hermes: missing `HERMES_PROVIDER_MODEL`

## Implemented Capability Surface

- Multi-agent orchestration includes engineering/reviewer/specialist flows, approval gates, owner escalation, follow-up inboxes, and parallel specialist runs.
- Harness-style execution is wired through deterministic mission execution, execution lease approval, foreground runtime session tracking, CLI controls, and operator UI controls.
- Hermes Agent adoption is represented through the Hermes provider, Hermes tool-call parsing, Hermes profile metadata, UI blueprint card, and `engineering-full-spectrum` runtime blueprint coverage.
- Reference-inspired extensions are covered by aggregate smoke tests for output compaction, provider guard/rate handling, document conversion, retrieval memory, fact graph memory, instruction-boundary fixtures, runtime discovery, visual evidence manifest, orchestration profiles, UI blueprints, parallel specialists, and process timeout handling.
- Release evidence is captured in evidence, closeout, visual manifest, handoff, and immutable snapshot artifacts.

## Live Provider Handoff

Run these only in an environment that is allowed to use real provider credentials or local model endpoints:

```bash
npm run preflight:execution-v1:all
export OPENAI_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS=60000 OPENAI_API_KEY="..." && npm run live:execution-v1:openai
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..." && npm run live:execution-v1:anthropic
export LOCAL_PROVIDER_BASE_URL="..." && npm run live:execution-v1:local
export HERMES_PROVIDER_MODEL="..." && npm run live:execution-v1:hermes
```

Expected pre-live state:

- `blockedCount` remains `0` when deterministic prerequisites are healthy.
- Providers without env/config remain `ready-but-missing-env` until their required value is injected.
- Provider account, billing, quota, or model access errors remain live blockers even when credentials are present.
- After env injection, live validation must be rerun before claiming provider-backed production readiness.

## Next Operator Steps

1. Resolve failed provider account-level blockers, then rerun only the affected `live:execution-v1:*` commands.
2. Inject local/Hermes runtime configuration in the target environment before claiming those provider paths.
3. Rerun `node scripts/build-execution-v1-evidence.mjs --live-<provider>`, `npm run closeout:execution-v1 -- --reuse-existing-evidence`, `npm run handoff:execution-v1`, and `npm run snapshot:execution-v1` after live validation if the release artifact must include updated live-provider proof.
4. Current verified commit is already contained in `origin/codex/managed-multi-agent-v1-foundation`; only commit/push again after intentionally changing release artifacts.

## Completion Boundary

Execution v1 is provider-scoped pilot ready for an OpenAI-backed bounded local-first path. It is not production-ready or live-provider-complete because Anthropic is blocked by provider account billing/credit, and local/Hermes live validation still requires target runtime configuration.

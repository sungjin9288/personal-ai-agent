# Devlog

## 2026-04-06 Managed Runtime Kickoff

- shifted the project from single-pass pack rendering to a managed multi-agent runtime
- established first-class runtime entities for sessions, agent runs, artifacts, approvals, and memory
- kept the implementation local-first and stub-provider based for deterministic development

## 2026-04-06 Reviewer And Approval Hardening

- added deliverable-aware reviewer rubric checks instead of relying on section presence alone
- added deterministic coverage for approval rejection and reviewer rubric failure
- kept the runtime local-first without introducing live provider dependencies

## 2026-04-06 Approval Resume Evidence

- changed approval approve handling to emit an `execution-ready-brief.md` handoff artifact instead of only flipping status
- split the approval approve path into its own deterministic smoke so the lifecycle now has stop, approve, and reject coverage

## 2026-04-06 Mission Memory Carry-Forward

- reviewer failures now persist mission-scoped fact memory
- approval decisions now persist mission-scoped decision memory
- reruns now prove that prior decision memory is injected back into manager context
- planner and executor now adapt rerun artifacts using prior mission memory instead of treating memory as display-only context

## 2026-04-06 Session History Surface

- added `session list <missionId>` and per-session summaries so reruns are directly inspectable
- extended `session show` to support `--session <sessionId>` for non-latest session inspection
- added deterministic coverage for multi-session history after reject-and-rerun

## 2026-04-06 Mission Timeline Surface

- enriched `mission show` with mission-level summary counts
- added `mission timeline <missionId>` to aggregate session, approval, and memory events in chronological order
- added deterministic coverage for mission-level timeline inspection after reject-and-rerun

## 2026-04-06 Workspace Overview Surface

- added `workspace overview <workspaceId>` to aggregate mission, session, approval, and memory state across one workspace
- kept `workspace show` as the raw workspace lookup and separated the operational view into a dedicated overview command
- added deterministic coverage for mixed completed/awaiting/failed mission states in one workspace

## 2026-04-06 Global Overview Surface

- added `overview global` to aggregate all workspaces into one control-plane view
- included a pending approval inbox so cross-workspace human action items are visible without drilling into each workspace
- added deterministic coverage for multi-workspace global aggregation and inbox behavior

## 2026-04-06 Approval Inbox Surface

- split the pending approval inbox into a dedicated `approval inbox` command instead of keeping it only as a nested global-overview field
- enriched inbox items with workspace, mission, session, and resolve-command context for operator use
- added deterministic coverage for inbox filtering and exclusion of resolved approvals

## 2026-04-06 Unified Action Inbox Surface

- added `action inbox` as a broader operator queue that combines pending approvals with current reviewer follow-up items
- kept `approval inbox` intact and reused the same approval aggregation logic so approval-only and mixed-action surfaces stay consistent
- added deterministic coverage to prove resolved approvals stay out and reviewer-failed latest sessions show actionable rerun guidance
